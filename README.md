This repository is retired
==========================

You probably want to use https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev and https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-projects now.  Please see this discussion on why this happened: http://bit.ly/17U3eMC

To migrate your repo to those:

 * http://blog.monotonous.org/2013/11/26/changing-gecko-git-mirrors/ is a quick way to migrate a single branch over.
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=929338 has a rebase script that can help you migrate.

Questions? Need help?  Ask in #git or ping ehsan at mozilla.
